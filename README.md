==========

This is the [task](TASK.md).

Things I would do if I hadn't time limit:

* Add tests for unsuccessful scenarios
* Add integration tests
* Add logs
* Create separate tables for matches and heroes
* Add indexes for created db tables
* Use separate classes for ingesting different events
* Rewrite if/else block in `gg.bayes.challenge.service.impl.MatchServiceImpl.ingestMatch` method
* Rewrite converters to get rid of boilerplate code
